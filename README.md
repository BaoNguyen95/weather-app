## Completions

Firstly, I want to say that I have spend much time to analyze the requirement and less time to fully complete this test, but I have tried my best.

1. Home page: Search bar, current weather, 5 days forecast
2. Current weather: All fields are getting from API, only wind icon is not implemented yet
3. API handling by *service* folder.
4. Because this test doesn't have much API so I'm refer to use React Context instead of Redux.
